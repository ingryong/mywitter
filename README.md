# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### “Absolute Imports”

./ 혹은 ../ 등의 상대 경로를 통한 import가 아닌 `src`폴더를 baseUrl로 설정하여 절대경로로 위치를 지정하게 한다.

### Firebase 사용

- Auth, datebase, storage, webhosting까지 백엔드 부분의 모든 처리를 firebase에 맡겨 프론트 개발에 집중할 수 있도록 한다.
